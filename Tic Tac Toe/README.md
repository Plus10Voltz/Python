# Tic Tac Toe
This is Naughts and crosses but vs an AI using the minimax algorithm. If it can't win, it will force a tie no matter what.
## Patch notes
* Fixed bug where if the AI wins, it would display player 1 has won when player 2 actually won
* Fixed bug where clicking an occupied space would count the players turn and the AI would then make a move
